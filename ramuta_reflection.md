What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
        I was struggling with Git workflow, specifically when were commits
        and pull requests were needed.
What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
        Gary, my pairs guide, was able to answer a bunch or git related
        questions that both my partner and I had. Specifically, he answered
        why commit messages were phrased in the present tense. He also clarified
        the point of staging files before a commit. Those are the only two that
        I can think of off the top of my head, but he did explain a lot.
What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
        I asked mostly about git workflow and GitHub workflow, like when is an
        appropirate time to push vs when is an appropriate time to commit. I
        also asked what the point of staging files before a commit because I
        didnt realize that one can commit multiple files at the same time. Also
        I asked about how to make a good commit message.
What still confuses you about Git?
        Although it was clarified during the GPS I still need to learn more about
        proper times to commit, push, an pull request. Also I think I could
        learn to make better commit messages.
How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
        It was good, I wish I would have really gone over the material throughly
        beforehand instead of just skimming it. Also, I learned that I should have
        moved faster through the material, since it took me and my partner
        almost doulbe the time to complete the session. Overall, I think the most
        valuable part of the experience was to literally talk out the steps that
        we needed to take to comlplete the task instead of just doing it all
        internally. I think that my partner and I did a good job of helping 
	eachother complete the tasks.
