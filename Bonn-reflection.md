* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
   * I didn't know the difference between pull and fetch in git.

* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
   * I learned that you can and often will carefully make multiple commits and then push those to git hub instead of pushing and merging everytime a simple change is made. 

* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
   * I asked about pulling after multiple commits, and I also asked them how they prefered the navigator/driver situation to be. I also asked my pair how to upload the screenshot of us and he was helpful in looking it up while I drove.

* What still confuses you about Git?
  * I need to know how to move forward if I've made a mistake, like creating a file before making a feature branch, and then deleting it, and making a new branch without there being a merge conflict later.

* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
   * It went well, although the work given took a lot longer than 60min, so I'll need to plan my schedule around it next time.
